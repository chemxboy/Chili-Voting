==================

Small solution built with PHP that has two parts.  The first is an iPad formatted site that will allow for Voting and submits the results to a Google Spreadsheet.  The second is a leaderboard that reads the results from the leaderboard and displays formatted for a TV. You will also require the Google Docs Zend API files (http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.docs.html).
